# DATA ART COMPETITION

The Data Art Competition was a contest organised by the collaboration bewteen the CEMS division of the University of Kent and the Institute of Cultural and Creative Industries (iCCi) [https://www.kent.ac.uk/institute-cultural-creative-industries](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kent.ac.uk%2Finstitute-cultural-creative-industries&data=05%7C01%7Cja683%40kent.ac.uk%7C6c5da19a869d467312dc08db3c1086c7%7C51a9fa563f32449aa7213e3f49aa5e9a%7C0%7C0%7C638169813918245049%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=acHv8U3hKqs7Pk5sQ6XViOjgZoaHNc7sAwhvr6Dsf%2Fs%3D&reserved=0) in 2023. The aim is to create digital generative art based on human bio data. The data was obtained from 80 participants watching a live performance (for approximately 1 hour) while wearing a commercial wristband. A sample of the data can be found in the Data folder.

The participants are required to write a piece of software, taking the PPG (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoplethysmogram](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPhotoplethysmogram&data=05%7C01%7Cja683%40kent.ac.uk%7C6c5da19a869d467312dc08db3c1086c7%7C51a9fa563f32449aa7213e3f49aa5e9a%7C0%7C0%7C638169813918245049%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wh%2BhYcy0JsrvguKg1rcptvMeSIxyJ%2Bcu4cTbtaaSHPk%3D&reserved=0)) as input and output an animation of 2D/3D visualisation.  This will require an algorithm to process the PPG data for each individual participant to output the visualisations specific to the person. A soundscape generated from the data can be included as part of the animation.

The `julia.ipynb` notebook contains most of the code, including everything related to create the animation and adding sound to it. The file `sound_scape.py` contains the methods to create the soundscape from the audio folder. 

A sample video showing a few animations has been added to the repository. The user is warned that producing a 20 second video may take anywhere between 3 to 6 hours.
